This repository has been made in the hope that a device like this becomes simpler to make.
```
I present to you: The Reduino Uno - A PCB-less Arduino Microcontroller Board...
...made from a sheet of translucent red Perspex/Plexiglass and some standard Pin Headers.
```

```
Why make a transparent Arduino? Mainly as an engineering challenge to see if
a microcontroller could be built 100% out of spare recycled parts from old projects.
```

```
Most microcontroller boards are printed with layers and layers of copper and silk screen.
This board has done away with that completely so it's able to let light pass through it.
```

```
Another thing that blocks the light is all those electronic components scattered around
everywhere for different purposes. This board has a really low component count compared.
